# SK MATHEMATICS PROJECT COMPETITION 2024

## Acknowledgement
  The researchers would like to thank our group advisor, teacher Rodelo, and Teacher Rolando 
for giving us essential information for our idea of innovation. Additionally, they have given us the 
opportunity to attend this astonishing competition. Moreover, the researchers would also like to 
thank Nattanan Vimuktanan for helping us conduct this research into reality by cooperating and 
reaching out to us when the researchers were puzzled, as without their support, this project would 
never have made it out of its brainstorming phase. The researchers would like to also show their 
appreciation to the participants for giving their time to participate in our experiment. They also would 
like to thank their guardians for supporting their research all the way from the brainstorming of the 
innovation to the conclusion of the project.

## Introduction
  Traditional teaching methods, especially in subjects like mathematics, are becoming less 
effective at engaging today’s students. To solve this issue, the researchers created a game-based 
website using HTML along with CSS, JavaScript, Python, and GPT-4o to enhance students’ interest in 
learning mathematics. The program is very easy to access with only a single link to access the 
platform which lets students learn anywhere and anytime. Moreover, the platform is available to all 
students of every age by using difficulty levels to separate. The researchers aim to let this platform 
coexist with a traditional learning method to let the traditional learning method work more 
effectively in the rise of the technology era. 

  In a fast-changing environment due to great technological advancement, the classroom 
environment and settings must inevitably be adapted to such future movement. Students nowadays 
have less interest in learning which is mainly due to the rise of the digital era. As technology 
continues to shape every aspect of our lives, students' attention and interest in learning are often 
overshadowed by the distractions of the digital world. The traditional classroom environment and 
settings will necessarily be used along with technological learning in a world of constant evolution 
due to technical and logical advancement.  

  This research mainly focuses on the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and GPT-4o to 
create a shift in students’ mathematical skills through an engaging website-based game. The website 
is designed to motivate students by unlocking rewards from the points they grant while progressing 
through various difficulty levels which encourage them to improve their mathematical skills. In an 
era of rapid technological advancement, the traditional teaching procedure must adapt to the 
current students' needs. Students’ attention is increasingly prevented by digital distractions which 
makes it important to foster a more engaging, technology-driven educational experience along with 
traditional learning.
